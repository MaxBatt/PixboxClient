        id="ResAuto"
        severity="Error"
        message="Suspicious namespace: Did you mean http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="9"
        summary="Finds resource namespaces with hardcoded package names"
        explanation="In Gradle projects, the actual package used in the final APK can vary; for you can add a `.debug` package suffix in one version and not the other. Therefore, you should *not* hardcode the application package in the resource; instead, use the special namespace `http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto` which will cause the tools to figure out the right namespace for the resource regardless of the actual package used during the build."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        category="Accessibility"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensures that image widgets provide a contentDescription"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.

Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute.

Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the `hint`. See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/checklist.html#special-cases."
